# labs-csharp-mstest
TDD, EAEP, and CSD labs in C# with VisualStudio.Net unit testing aka "MSTest"

These are the C# labs for Agile Institute's Essential Test-Driven Development course, and Advanced Certified Scrum Developer course.

At this time, each lab has it's own subfolder within the repo, which--in hindsight--probably wasn't such a good idea, 
but that seems to work fairly well for VS.Net and JetBrains Rider, so there's not much impetus to change at this point.
